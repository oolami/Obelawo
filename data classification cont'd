1. Define the Purpose

Before anything technical, you need clarity on:

Why are we classifying data? (Compliance? DR readiness? Least-privilege? SOC2? Internal audit?)

What problem are we trying to solve?
(Unauthorized access, unencrypted buckets, secrets misuse, etc.)

This becomes the backbone of your scope.

✅ 2. Build a Simple Data Classification Model

Most companies use a 3–4 tier model:

Example: 4-Level Classification
Level	Examples	Required Controls
Public	Website content, marketing docs	No restriction
Internal	Internal emails, internal dashboards	Minimal access control
Confidential	Customer data, employee data, configs	Encryption, RBAC, logging
Restricted	SSN, PII, PHI, financials, secrets, private keys	Strong encryption, strict RBAC, monitoring, tokenization

You can adopt or modify this.

✅ 3. Build the Data Flow Inventory

You cannot classify data until you know:

What data you have

Where the data lives

Where the data moves

Who can access it

How it is processed

Create an inventory for each:

S3 buckets

Databases (RDS, Dynamo, On-prem SQL)

File shares, FSx

Cache layers (Redis, ElasticCache)

Application logs

Secrets (SSM, Vault, IAM, GitHub secrets, etc.)

API data flows

K8s volumes

CI/CD logs (GitLab, GitHub, Jenkins)

This is where most security gaps show up.

✅ 4. Assign Classification Levels to Each Data Type

Examples:

Data Type	Classification
Customer PII	Restricted
API keys	Restricted
Application logs with user identifiers	Confidential
DNS zones	Internal
Marketing assets	Public

This is your Phase 1 deliverable.

✅ 5. Map Classification to Required Controls

Now you tie it into encryption, data at rest, in transit, in use, etc.

🚀 Use Cases (Exactly What You Can Work On)
Use Case 1: Data at Rest (Storage Security)

Look at existing storage and evaluate whether encryption is enabled.

Examples:

Check if S3 buckets use AES-256 / KMS encryption

Ensure EBS volumes have encryption by default

Ensure RDS and DynamoDB encryption is turned on

Validate FSx encryption settings

Deliverable:
A chart showing which data stores are encrypted or not, based on classification level.

Use Case 2: Data in Transit

Focus on securing how data moves.

Check:

ALB → Target TLS enforcement

TLS policies on Load Balancers (e.g., TLS 1.2 minimum)

API Gateway → ensure encryption enforced

Redis/ElastiCache encryption in transit

Database connections using SSL

Internal service-to-service traffic using mTLS (if applicable)

SSH access replaced with SSM Session Manager where possible

Deliverable:
List of services currently using plaintext traffic → remediation plan.

Use Case 3: Data in Use

This is the hardest category. You're focusing on:

Secrets handling in CI/CD

IAM roles vs long-lived keys

Tokens stored in memory

Application code storing data in local cache

Preventing access to plaintext secrets in pipeline logs

Deliverable:
A report on where data is exposed during processing (logs, pipelines, screenshots, debug prints).

Use Case 4: Automated Discovery of Sensitive Data

Pick one:

S3 Macie

GuardDuty

DLP tools (Netskope, Microsoft Purview, Splunk Enterprise Security)

GitHub Advanced Security (secret scanning)

Elastic/Kibana PII detection in logs

Deliverable:
A list of high-risk buckets or logs containing PII.

Use Case 5: IAM Access & Least Privilege Based on Classification

Tie classification to access control:

Restricted → Only IAM roles allowed, tightly scoped

Confidential → Limited teams

Internal → General org-level access

Public → No AWS access controls needed

Deliverable:
A model showing which IAM roles/users should access which data types.

Use Case 6: Encryption Key Management

Identify:

What KMS keys exist

Who can use them

What is customer-managed vs AWS-managed

Rotation policy

Key misuse (e.g., same key used for unrelated environments)

Deliverable:
KMS key inventory + recommended restructuring.

Use Case 7: Secrets and Credentials Cleanup

Review:

IAM users with access keys

Hardcoded secrets in code repos

Secrets stored in GitHub/GitLab pipelines

Access keys older than 90 days

Deliverable:
A secrets maturity assessment.

Use Case 8: Log Data Classification

Logs often leak sensitive data.

Check:

Application logs

CloudTrail

VPC Flow Logs

Nginx/ALB logs

Ensure PII is masked before logs reach S3 or CloudWatch.

Use Case 9: Data Retention & Expiry

Tie classification to retention:

Restricted → shorter retention & strict deletion

Confidential → 90–180 days

Internal → longer

Public → unlimited

🧩 What To Work On First (Priority Order)
Phase 1 — Foundation

Define classification levels

Create a data inventory

Categorize each data type

Phase 2 — Technical Controls

Encryption at rest audit

Encryption in transit audit

IAM access mapping

Phase 3 — Detection & Ongoing Governance

Automated PII scanning

Log sanitization

DLP controls

Retention policies
